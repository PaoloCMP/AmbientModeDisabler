# AmbientModeDisabler

A simple javascript snippet to turn off automatically the "Ambient Mode" option on youtube.

It requires a lot of CPU/GPU and especially in the older PCs it causes the slowmotion effect while playing a video, so you have to turn it off manually.

With this code, that you can add as a browser extension, this will be done automatically.

Hope it helps, maybe available on chrome web extensions later.

Tested on Brave browser.

Feel free to use and fork it
