# Ambient Mode Disabler

### What 
A simple javascript snippet to turn off automatically the "Ambient Mode" option on youtube.

### Why
Ambient Mode requires a lot of CPU/GPU and especially in the older PCs it causes the slowmotion effect while playing a video, so you have to turn it off manually.
With this code, that you can add as a browser extension, this will be done automatically.

### Where
Tested on Brave browser.
But it should works on every chromium browser

### How
 - Download the zip and extract it.
 - In the address bar search for this: 'chrome://extensions'.
 - Enable Developer Mode and switch into it.
 - Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.
 
 You've installed the extension successfully
